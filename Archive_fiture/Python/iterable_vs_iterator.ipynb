    "# Question\n",
    "Why are there some non-sequence object than can be used in for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concept\n",
    "## Iterable\n",
    "1. It is capable of returning the value each at a time. \n",
    "2. must implement __iter__ method or __getitem__ method that implements sequence semantic\n",
    "## Iterator\n",
    "1. It is an object representing a stream of data.\n",
    "2. return successive items in a stream by calling to its __next__ method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterable** is an object that contains the values, and can return its values one at each time. The **iterator** is an executor that actually do the returning values for the **Iterable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the question, **for** loop needs the iterable as the input, and it will call the iter() method for you automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. Although it is required to implement the __iter__ method inside **iterator** to make itself iterable, but it is not obeied inside CPython.\n",
